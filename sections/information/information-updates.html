              <p class="standard-text">
                Even though the causes listed above are very important, here at
                Lockdown Lifesavers we realise that the first and most important
                thing to do is to look after yourself and those around you.
                Making sure that you personally are coping with the strange time
                we find ourselves in gives the basis to then being able to help
                others. For this reason we here offer some simple, easy to
                manage advice for dealing with each day during lockdown.

                Finally, and importantly, don't worry if you don't always follow
                the advice above. Above all it is important to get through the
                situation happily and healthily, we all deal with things
                differently.
