              Lockdown Lifesavers was created to be an outlet for people stuck
              in lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdown has
              proved to be a tough time for a lot of people and Lockdown
              Lifesavers hopes to serve as an information source, charity
              fundraiser and also a place where people can find something to
              occupy their time without feeling like days are boring or wasted.

            <h2 class="sub-heading not-top">About Us</h2>
            <p class="standard-text">
              Lockdown Lifesavers was created by one person, Tommy Brader, as
              part of a Final Project for a Digital Media Culture MA at
              <a
                href="https://www.bbk.ac.uk/"

                target="_blank"
                >Birkbeck, University of London</a
              >. I decided to create a website like this as it is highly
              relevant to the world in which I have been completing my master's.
              The website is also a concept broad enough to serve as a way for
              me to display various skills and techniques for design and coding
              I have learnt during my studies and also as part of research for
              the project.
            </p>
            <p class="standard-text">
              Lockdown Lifesavers is my second attempt at designing a full
              website using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The first of which,
              The Penguin Information Project, can be found by clicking the link
              underneath the random penguin.
