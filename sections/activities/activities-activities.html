              The Activities page offers some suggestions on how you can spend
              your time in lockdown. This can range from active activities such
              as exercises and recipes but also some more passive activities
              like film and TV reccomendations.

              number of set categories. In addition to the reccomendations, a
              randomised film and tv show is also provided which will hopefully
              go towards inspiring your next watch.
